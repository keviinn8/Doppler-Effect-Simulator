# Doppler-Effect-Simulator
## An application created to simulate a Doppler Effect animation and calculate the frequency heard.

This physics application serves as an interactive Doppler Effect simulator designed to visually demonstrate the principles behind the concept. It features a dynamic system where users can control the motion of both the source and the observer, observing in real-time how the relative velocities affect the perceived frequency of sound waves. The simulator not only visualizes the propagation of sound waves but also calculates the observed frequency using the Doppler equation, providing both a theoretical and experiential understanding.

### Some of the features of the application:
* Home window 
* Scene switch feature 
* Custom logo icon 
* Date and time 
* Slider modifiers 
* Speed of sound options 
* Media sound controller 
* Animation display 
* Animation display 
* Frequency calculator 
* ComboBox for the characters 
* Start and stop animation buttons 
* Reset animation button 
* Clear waves button 
* Moving background
